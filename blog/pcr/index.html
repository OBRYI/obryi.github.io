        <p>First of all, I’m glad to see you here, reading this. Thank you!</p>
        <p>And another thing I wanted to say before proceeding to the artwork-talk is that I’m thinking about change in
            my
            social-media approach, I’m going to reinvent how I communicate my work to the audience. I like format of
            this
            blog, however, I’m going to think about more popular ways to share my art into the world.</p>

            (im)perfection
        </h2>
        <h3>short story of creation</h3>
        <p>Imperfect, what do you think about when you consider this word? I think about human being, sometimes, myself
            come
            up first. This artwork is not about human being, but at the same time it’s about us.</p>
        <p>The idea behind this artwork was growing for a while now. First concept was born last year. I thought, what
            if we
            change viewport of 3d scene for real-world picture , and would be able to experience it the same way we
            experience interface of 3d software. I didn’t succeed, I implemented core of this concept but it was
            limited,
            because my program didn’t even make use of any photogrammetry algorithms which allows to scan environment
            with
            just photos. What I did instead is aligned photos manually, it was interesting but not at all what I
            expected.
        </p>
        <p>Recently, inspiration hit and I did the “(im)perfection”, it also doesn’t make use of complicated algorithms.
            Instead, it does somewhat translates experience of 3d software, this time it wasn’t ideal either, but I was
            satisfied.</p>
        <h3>ok, but what it is about?</h3>
        <p>It’s about how our plans and vision of life are not quite the same as how it turns out to be in life. Meshes
            of
            figures are symbol for how we direct our life, e.g. plans for tomorrow, big and small dreams etc. Sketches
            are
            for how our plans and dreams come out to be if they ever do. Large white space around focus of the artwork
            is a
            symbol for forgotten/unfulfilled plans and dreams. It’s simple, yet, there’s another important component to
            it.
            The rough rotation is for unclear vision that we have it is for biases that we deal with when involved in
            processes of dreaming and making these dreams come true.</p>
